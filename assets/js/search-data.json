Use dropdown menu to select specific age range . - Hover the mouse over a country for a risk comparison to some sports and travel modes.- &quot;Micromorts&quot; are a measure of risk equal to 1 in a Million probability of death.- Risk of death calculated for the unvaccinated or not previosly infected. . .

Monthly risk calculation: $$ Monthly ,Risk = Infection ,Fatality ,Rate_{age ,group} cdot P_{montly ,infection} , P_{montly ,infection} = 1 - (1 - P_{daily ,infection}) ^ {30 ,days} , P_{daily ,infection} = frac{Actively ,Infected , % cdot Transmission ,Rate , %} {1 - Actively ,Infected , % - Recovered ,or , Dead , %} $$ &quot;Actively Infected&quot; and &quot;Recovered or Dead&quot; population percentages are estimated from past deaths and cases (See estimations appendix in estimations &amp; projections notebook). | Age specific IFRs are taken from recent Nature international meta-study of IFRs. | Country demographics for country average IFRs are taken from UN demographic data for 2020. | Micromort deaths risk comparative data (travel and sports) are taken from Wikipedia article on Micromorts. | The calculation is done on daily basis and extrapolated naively to a month. | . | Why is everything &quot;monthly&quot;? The main actionable question this analysis aims to help answer is &quot;How much risk is someone taking by not getting vaccinated now? What is the risk of waiting another month?&quot;. A daily timescale for this question is too short due to not being actionable, and on a scale much longer than a month the underlying data for calculations will change substantially (e.g. transmission rates, currently infected population) to not offer a reasonable appoximation. So a month felt to me as roughly the right time scale for the risk aggregation that is both easy to think about and should still be roughly correct. | Assumptions &amp; limitations: The esposure is assumed to be average exposure typical of that country (as it manifests in the recent case and deaths data). Protective measures (e.g. masks) and self isolation should of course reduce the risk (if practiced more than the average for that population at that time). | Susceptible population is assumed to not yet be vaccinated. When vaccination prevalence will become substantial, data will become available, and calculations can be adjusted. The risk estimates are for regular susceptible population. People who have been infected already are excluded (as recovered). | All rates and percentages such as: transmission rate, active and recovered percentages are assumed to be constant during the month to keep the monthly calculation simple. This is of course NOT true. However although these rates do change, they usually change slowly enough for the likely result to still be of the same order of magnitude. It is possible to use values from a predictive model for this, but they too have errors (as they too are simplistic). For this analysis I preferred to go with the simple to calculate / understand approximation with a well understood error, than with the complex to calculate / understand approximation with an unknown error. | All the additional assumptions from estimations appendix in estimations &amp; projections notebook | . | Vaccination effect on risk: The risk for the vaccinated is not calculated here. It is currently widely assumed that the reported Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech might reduce the chance of infection by around 90%. | While there are well founded estimates for the effect on infection chance, the effect on IFR (fatality rate) is much less known: how does vaccination affect the severity of the desease if infected? Answering this will require studying millions of vaccinated people, so will only be available later. | . | Additional related analyses: Another map of statistics of cases, deaths, ICU need and affected population percentage can be explored in world-map part of the estimations &amp; projections notebook) | Per country predictive models of population ratios can be explored in trajectories plots in estimations &amp; projections notebook | . | .",

This is an attempt to understand what&#39;s happening, and what the future looks like if current trends remain unchanged. | Everything is approximated and depends heavily on underlying assumptions. | Transmission rate calculation: Growth rate is calculated over the 5 past days by averaging the daily growth rates. | Confidence bounds are calculated from the weighted standard deviation of the growth rate over the last 5 days. Model predictions are calculated for growth rates within 1 STD of the weighted mean. The maximum and minimum values for each day are used as confidence bands. Countries with highly noisy transmission rates are exluded from tranmission rate change tables (&quot;new waves&quot;, &quot;slowing waves&quot;). | Transmission rate, and its STD are calculated from growth rate and its STD using active cases estimation. | For projections (into future) very noisy projections (with broad confidence bounds) are not shown in the tables. | Where the rate estimated from Total Outstanding Cases is too high (on down-slopes) recovery probability if 1/20 is used (equivalent 20 days to recover). | . | Total cases are estimated from the reported deaths for each country: Each country has a different testing policy and capacity and cases are under-reported in some countries. Using an estimated IFR (fatality rate) we can estimate the number of cases some time ago by using the total deaths until today. | IFRs for each country is estimated using the age adjusted IFRs from May 1 New York paper and UN demographic data for 2020. These IFRs can be found in df[&#39;age_adjusted_ifr&#39;] column. Some examples: US - 0.98%, UK - 1.1%, Qatar - 0.25%, Italy - 1.4%, Japan - 1.6%. | The average fatality lag is assumed to be 8 days on average for a case to go from being confirmed positive (after incubation + testing lag) to death. This is the same figure used by &quot;Estimating The Infected Population From Deaths&quot;. | Testing bias adjustment: the actual lagged fatality rate is than divided by the IFR to estimate the testing bias in a country. The estimated testing bias then multiplies the reported case numbers to estimate the true case numbers (=case numbers if testing coverage was as comprehensive as in the heavily tested countries). | . | ICU need is calculated and age-adjusted as follows: UK ICU ratio was reported as 4.4% of active reported cases. | Using UKs ICU ratio, UK&#39;s testing bias, and IFRs corrected for age demographics we can estimate each country&#39;s ICU ratio (the number of cases requiring ICU hospitalisation). | . | .",

Methodology . I&#39;m not an epidemiologist. This is an attempt to understand what&#39;s happening, and what the future looks like if current trends remain unchanged. | Everything is approximated and depends heavily on underlying assumptions. | Projection is done using a simple SIR model (see examples) combined with the approach in Total Outstanding Cases: Growth rate is calculated over the 5 past days by averaging the daily growth rates. | Confidence bounds are calculated by from the weighted standard deviation of the growth rate over the last 5 days. Model predictions are calculated for growth rates within 1 STD of the weighted mean. The maximum and minimum values for each day are used as confidence bands. | Transmission rate, and its STD are calculated from growth rate and its STD using active cases estimation mentioned above. | For projections (into future) very noisy projections (with broad confidence bounds) are not shown in the tables. | Where the rate estimated from Total Outstanding Cases is too high (on down-slopes) recovery probability if 1/20 is used (equivalent 20 days to recover). | . | Total cases are estimated from the reported deaths for each country: Each country has a different testing policy and capacity and cases are under-reported in some countries. Using an estimated IFR (fatality rate) we can estimate the number of cases some time ago by using the total deaths until today. | IFRs for each country is estimated using the age adjusted IFRs from International IFRS study and UN demographic data for 2020. These IFRs can be found in df[&#39;age_adjusted_ifr&#39;] column. | The average fatality lag is assumed to be 8 days on average for a case to go from being confirmed positive (after incubation + testing lag) to death. This is the same figure used by &quot;Estimating The Infected Population From Deaths&quot;. | Testing bias adjustment: the actual lagged case fatality rate is then divided by the age adjusted IFR to estimate the testing bias in a country. To account for testing bias changes (e.g. increased testing capacity) this is done on a rolling window basis of two months (with at least 300 deaths). The estimated testing bias then multiplies the reported case numbers for each date to estimate the true case numbers (=case numbers that would be consistent with the deaths and the age adjusted IFR). | . | ICU need is calculated and age-adjusted as follows: UK ICU ratio was reported as 4.4% of active reported cases. | Using UKs ICU ratio, UK&#39;s testing bias, and IFRs corrected for age demographics we can estimate each country&#39;s ICU ratio (the number of cases requiring ICU hospitalisation). | Active cases for ICU estimation are taken from the SIR model. | Pre COVID-19 ICU capacities are from Wikipedia (OECD countries mostly) and CCB capacities in Asia. The current capacities are likely much higher as some countries already doubled or even quadrupled their ICU capacities. | . | .",

John Hopkin&#39;s University&#39;s (JHU) dataset initially reported recovered cases but has since discontinued this, however estimating the recovery duration and extrapolating for current cases should be possible from this original data. . For the time being (I hope to draw from other discussions of this topic), I will use an empirically derived formula from the limited data available from JHU: . $$R_{n} = R_{n-1} + (C_{n-9} - R_{n-1})*0.07$$ . Where $R_{n}$ is the total number of recovered cases on day $n$, and $C_{n}$ is the total number of confirmed cases on day $n$. . What it implies is that on a given day, of the cases which were first reported 9 days previously 7% of those cases would have either recovered or passed away. After 16 days therefore 49% of cases would have recovered or passed away and after 23 days 98% of cases would have recovered or passsed away. . This formula is only being used to predict the number of recoveries from the time that JHU&#39;s data is not available. We can compare the results of this formula to the existing data from JHU to show the level of fit. This can be seen in the following 2 graphs. . Visualizations and analysis by Adrian Turcato1 . .
